Thanks to [Eddy Verbruggen](EddyVerbruggen) for providing [nativescript-taptic-engine](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/nativescript-taptic-engine) as this continues its evolution by streamlining the API and adding Android support, inspired by [react-native-haptic-feedback](https://github.com/junina-de/react-native-haptic-feedback).

## Installation

```cli
npm install @nativescript/haptics
```

## API

### isSupported()
```ts
isHapticsSupported: boolean = Haptics.isSupported()
```
Checks if Haptics is supported.

---
### is6SAnd6SPlusSupported()
```ts
isHapticsSupported: boolean = Haptics.is6SAnd6SPlusSupported()
```

Checks if Haptics is supported on iOS.

---
### selection()

```ts
import { Haptics } from "@nativescript/haptics";

Haptics.selection();
```

### notification()

```ts
import { Haptics, HapticNotificationType } from "@nativescript/haptics";

Haptics.notification(HapticNotificationType.ERROR);
```

Use notification feedback generators to indicate success, failure, and warning.

Other haptic notification types are:
- `SUCCESS`(default)
- `WARNING`

### impact()

```js
import { Haptics, HapticImpactType } from "@nativescript/haptics";

Haptics.impact(HapticImpactType.HEAVY);
```

Use impact feedback generators to indicate that an impact has occurred.
For example, you might trigger impact feedback when a user interface object
collides with something or snaps into place.

There are 3 impact types: 
- `LIGHT` 
- `MEDIUM` (default)
- `HEAVY`.

### HapticsFallback

To use the haptics fallbacks, first check if there is support:

```ts
if (!Haptics.isSupported() && Haptics.is6SAnd6SPlusSupported()) {
  // use HapticsFallback
}
```

__BEWARE__ This uses an undocumented feature that may get your app rejected when reviewed by Apple.
[People have used this approach __without problems__ though.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32526868/taptic-in-ios-9)

### weakBoom()
This triggers the same effect as the 'Peek' in 'Peek & Pop', a very brief vibration.

```ts
import { HapticsFallback } from "@nativescript/haptics";

HapticsFallback.weakBoom();
```

### strongBoom()
```ts
import { HapticsFallback } from "@nativescript/haptics";

HapticsFallback.strongBoom();
```
This triggers the 'Pop' effect of 'Peek & Pop', which is a bit more profound than the 'Peek' effect.

### burst()
```ts
import { HapticsFallback } from "@nativescript/haptics";

HapticsFallback.burst();
```
This triggers the 'Nope' effect you get when force-touching a home icon that doesn't have any action. It's a short burst of 3-ish 'weak booms'.
