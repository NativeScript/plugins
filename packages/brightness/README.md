# @nativescript/brightness

```cli
ns plugin add @nativescript/brightness
```

This command automatically installs the necessary files, as well as stores @nativescript/brightness as a dependency in your project's `package.json` file.

This plugin requires `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS"/>` to be added in the android manifest.

## Usage

To use the brightness module you must first `require()` and instantiate it:

```javascript
// JavaScript
var nativescriptBrightness = require('@nativescript/brightness');
var brightness = new nativescriptBrightness.Brightness();
```

Or if youâ€™re using TypeScript, `import` the module:

```typescript
// TypeScript
import { Brightness } from '@nativescript/brightness';
const brightness = new Brightness();
```

After you have a reference to the module you can then call its `get()` and `set()` methods. For example, the code below updates you screen's brightness with an `intensity` setting of 25%.

The `intensity` can be set to a value from 1 to 100.

```js
// TypeScript
import { Brightness } from '@nativescript/brightness';
const brightness = new Brightness();

brightness.set({
	intensity: 25,
});
```
