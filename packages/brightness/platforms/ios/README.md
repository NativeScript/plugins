# iOS permissions and dependencies


* (Optional) Use Info.plist to describe any permissions, features or other configuration specifics required or used by your plugin for iOS. 
NOTE: The NativeScript CLI will not resolve any contradicting or duplicate entries during the merge. After the plugin is installed, you need to manually resolve such issues.
* (Optional) Use build.xcconfig configuration to describe any plugin the native dependencies. If there are no such, this file can be removed. For more information, see the [build.xcconfig Specification section](http://docs.nativescript.org/plugins/plugins#buildxcconfig-specification).
