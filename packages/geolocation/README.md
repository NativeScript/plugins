## Intro

A geolocation plugin to use for getting current location, monitor movement, etc.

## Installation

To install the plugin, run the following command in the  root  of your project.

```cli
npm install @nativescript/geolocation
```

## Android permissions requirements

To use geolocation on Android, you need to add the following permissions to your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` inside the `App_Resources/Android/src/main` directory:

```xml
  <!-- Always include this permission -->
  <!-- This permission is for "approximate" location data -->
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />

  <!-- Include only if your app benefits from precise location access. -->
  <!-- This permission is for "precise" location data -->
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />

  <!-- Required only when requesting background location access on
       Android 10 (API level 29) and higher. -->
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
```

More information can be found in the [Android docs here](https://developer.android.com/training/location/permissions).

## iOS permissions requirements

If `iosAllowsBackgroundLocationUpdates` property of the [options](#options-interface) object is set to `true`, the following code is required in the `App_Resources/iOS/Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>location</string>
</array>
```

## Use @nativescript/geolocation

### Get current location

Before you call any method that gets the user's location, request for the user's permission by calling the `enableLocationRequest` method. Once the user has granted the permission, you can call the `getCurrentLocation()` method, passing it a [options](#options) object to get the user's current location.

```ts
import * as geolocation from '@nativescript/geolocation';
import { CoreTypes } from '@nativescript/core' // used to describe at what accuracy the location should get

geolocation.enableLocationRequest().then(() => {
    
    geolocation.getCurrentLocation({ desiredAccuracy: CoreTypes.Accuracy.high, maximumAge: 5000, timeout: 20000 }).then((currentLocation) => {

      console.log("My current latitude: ", currentLocation.latitude)
    })
  })
```

## API
### Plugin functions

The plugin provides the following functions for getting current location and more:

| Method  | Returns    | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `getCurrentLocation(options: Options)`                                                                   | Promise\<[Location](#location)\> | Gets current location applying the specified options (if any). Since version 5.0 of the plugin, it will use [requestLocation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/1620548-requestlocation?language=objc) API for devices using `iOS 9.0+`. In situation of poor or no GPS signal, but available Wi-Fi it will take 10 sec to return the location.<br> The `options` parameter is optional. |
| `watchLocation(successCallback: successCallbackType, errorCallback: errorCallbackType, options?: Options)` | `number`              | Monitors location change.   |
| `watchPermissionStatus(permissionCallback: permissionCallbackType, errorCallback: errorCallbackType)`      | `number`              | (`iOS-only`)Monitors a change in location permission.|
| `clearWatch(watchId: number)` | `void` | Stops monitoring a change in location. The `watchId` parameter is returned from the `watchLocation()` method.  |
| `enableLocationRequest(always?: boolean, openSettingsIfLocationHasBeenDenied?: boolean`                   | `Promise<void> `    | Asks for permissions to use location services. On iOS if `always` is `true`, add the following keys to the `Info.plist`: [NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nslocationalwaysandwheninuseusagedescription) (iOS 11.0+) OR [NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nslocationalwaysusagedescription?language=objc) (iOS 8.0-10.0) and [NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nslocationwheninuseusagedescription). Read more about [request always usage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/1620551-requestalwaysauthorization). On Android `SDK >= 29`, the `always` parameter set to `true` requires the  `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` permission to be added to the `AndroidManifest.xml`. That results in the user getting a system dialog with the option `'allow all the time'` option. Read about Android location permissions [here](https://developer.android.com/training/location/permissions) and [here](https://developer.android.com/training/location/permissions#request-background-location). If `openSettingsIfLocationHasBeenDenied` is `true` and the permission has previously been denied then the Settings app will open so the user can change the location services permission. See the [exception](#android-api-level-30---opensettingsiflocationhasbeendenied) to this.|
|`isEnabled(options?: Options)` | `Promise<boolean>`  | Resolves `true` or `false` based on the location services availability. |
| `distance(loc1: Location, loc2: Location)`  | `number ` | Calculates the distance between two locations. Returns the distance in meters. |
| `getIOSLocationManagerStatus()`| [CLAuthorizationStatus](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clauthorizationstatus?language=objc)|  Returns the status of the Location Authorization permission.|

### Location class
 
 This is a data class that encapsulates the following common properties for a geolocation.

| ------------------ |------|------------------------------------------------------- |
| `latitude`         | `number`| The latitude of the geolocation, in degrees.            |
| `longitude`        | `number`|  The longitude of the geolocation, in degrees.           |
| `altitude`         | `number`|  The altitude (if available), in meters above sea level. |
| `horizontalAccuracy` | `number`|  The horizontal accuracy, in meters.                     |

## Known issues

### Version conflicts with Google Play Services

If you have installed multiple plugins that use the Google Play Services you might run into version conflicts. For example, you may encounter the error below when using the [nativescript-google-maps-sdk](https://github.com/dapriett/nativescript-google-maps-sdk) plugin:

```ts
"Cannot enable the location service. Error: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Failed resolution of: Lcom/google/android/gms/internal/zzbck;"
```

To fix that error, you might pin the version number in your `app/App_Resources/Android/before-plugins.gradle` file (if the file does not exist, create it):

```gradle
android {  
  // other stuff here

  project.ext {
    googlePlayServicesVersion = "16.+"
  }
}
```

### openSettingsIfLocationHasBeenDenied on Android API level 30

If the user declines the permission twice during the installation lifetime of the app on Android API level 30 , the user won't be taken to the settings even if the `openSettingsIfLocationHasBeenDenied` option is true for `enableLocationRequest()`.
