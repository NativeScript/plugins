## Configuration

No additional configuration required!

## Usage

To use the `PickerField` in markup you need to:

- If you are developing a NativeScript Core app, you need to register the plugin namespace in the xml:

```xml
<Page
   xmlns="http://schemas.nativescript.org/tns.xsd"
   xmlns:picker="@nativescript/picker">
   <picker:PickerField hint="Click here" items="{{ pickerItems }}"/>
...
```

- If you are developing a NativeScript Angular app, you need to import the plugin module in the module of your component:

```ts
import { NativeScriptPickerModule } from "@nativescript/picker/angular";
...
@NgModule({
    imports: [
        NativeScriptPickerModule,
        ...
    ],
    ...
```

Then you will be able to declare the fields in the html of your component:

```html
<PickerField hint="Click here" [items]="pickerItems"></PickerField>
```

### Custom item template

You can also define your own item template in the list that is opened:

```html
<PickerField hint="Click here" class="picker-field" textField="name" [pickerTitle]="'Select item from list'" [items]="items">
	<ng-template let-item="item">
		<GridLayout columns="auto, *" rows="auto, *">
			<Label text="Static text:" col="0"></Label>
			<Label [text]="item?.name" col="0" row="1"></Label>
			<Image [src]="item?.imageUrl" col="1" row="0" rowSpan="2"></Image>
		</GridLayout>
	</ng-template>
</PickerField>
```

With the following bindings:

```ts
interface IDataItem {
	name: string;
	id: number;
	description: string;
	imageUrl: string;
}

this.items = new ObservableArray<IDataItem>();
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
	this.items.push({
		name: 'Item ' + i,
		id: i,
		description: 'Description ' + i,
		imageUrl: 'https://picsum.photos/150/70/?random',
	});
}
```

- If you are developing a NativeScript Vue app, you need to install the plugin in you app.js file:

```js
import Vue from 'nativescript-vue';
import { PickerField } from '@nativescript/picker/vue';

Vue.use(PickerField);
```

Then you will be able to declare the fields in the template of your component:

```html
<PickerField hint="Click here"></PickerField>
```

## Features

### PickerField

The `PickerField` is a NativeScript `TextField` which means that any functionality the default `TextField` provides is also available in the `PickerField` component. The only difference is that by design it is in "read-only" mode, or simply put you cannot change its text by input or select that text. Changing the text of the `PickerField` is done by its main functionality which is opening a modal popup that shows a list of objects from which you can select one by tapping it.

### PickerField

The `PickerField` can be targeted in CSS through its element selector and additionally by setting a class. The `PickerField` also opens a modal window containing a Page element that contains an ActionBar and a ListView. This Page element can be targeted with the `PickerPage` selector and through it style all picker modals with selectors like `PickerPage ActionBar` and `PickerPage ListView`. In addition to that, if you set a class on the PickerField, it will be transferred on the `PickerPage` and with it you can style individual modals.
